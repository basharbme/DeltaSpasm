- The bed holders (Bed Holder.jpg) are designed to support a 13" (330 mm) x 0.25" (6.25 mm) aluminum tooling plate that is heated by a 310 mm silicone heater.  There is 13 mm clearance to accomodate (a) 6.35 mm aluminum plate (b) 4 mm cork sheet (c) 3.175 mm glass plate.  One of the bed holders is notched to allow for clearance of the bed heater wires and thermistor.  
- A set of motor covers (See *.jpg files - Motor Covers Bottom and Top for differences) prevent debris from falling into the stepper motors and finish off the top of the printing surface.  There are two types, one of which has increased clearance on the sides to accomodate wires running along the sides of the 2040 extrusions

- Hall Endstops (Hall endstop.jpg) are mounted to holders and include modified carriages that accomodate small N50 super magnets

- The Cooling Fan Assembly (Cooling fan Assembly Printed.jpg) is designed for use with Beaglebone Black and Replicapae to keep the electronics isolated from the bottom of the bed heater and motor compartments and provide for directed cooling.  It may be necessary to include an additional fan for a push/pull configuration.
